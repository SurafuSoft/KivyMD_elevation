# KivyMD_elevation
Basic KivyMD set-up and trying to change elevation of widgets.
(Material Design uses elevation (z-axis) to drop shadow of higher widgets on lower widgets.)

Specifically trying to:
- `MDAccordion` same elevation as `MDBottomNavigation`
- No shadow from `MDTabbedPanel` on `SingleLineTextField` and `MDRaisedButton` (lower elevation)
